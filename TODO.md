BEFORE WEDNESDAY:
- [ ] Figure out binding structure
- [ ] Write simple compiler
- [ ] Prep for code walk

NICE TO HAVE:
- [ ] `:-` macro

NEXT STEPS:
- [ ] Better interfaces for `solution` and `database`
- [ ] Implement `choose`


QUESTIONS:
- Michael's hack from Piazza:
  - We only want `bind` and `ref` for static checks, not for compilation.
    Would we have a second syntax spec, in that case? That feels weird...
