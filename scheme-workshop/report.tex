\section{Introduction}

\Dusa{}~\cite{martens2025dusa} % maybe cite dusa.rocks impl too?
is a recently designed logic programming language featuring
\emph{mutually exclusive choice} as a primitive to enable
computation of solutions that satisfy constraints.

% TODO: sentence to bridge this gap?

We introduce \miniDusa{}, a \Dusa{}-inspired
% TODO: (nit) italics are awkward here. maybe omit DSL? 
\emph{hosted domain-specific language} (DSL) implemented using Racket and
the \syntaxspec{} metalanguage~\cite{ballantyne2024pearl}. % cite docs?
This architecture lets our implementation inherit tooling and features
from the host, like macro-extensibility, essentially ``for free''.


\section{miniDusa by Example}

A finite-choice logic program describes \emph{solutions}
(i.e. sets of consistent facts), which are obtained using a \emph{solver}.
To illuminate the semantics of \miniDusa{}, we walk through
a program whose solutions are the 3-colorings of some graph:

\begin{verbatim}
(logic
  (edge 'a 'b) (edge 'a 'c)  ; ... more ...
  ((edge X Y) :- (edge Y X))
  ((node X) :- (edge X _))
\end{verbatim}
A finite-choice logic program consists of \emph{facts} and \emph{rules},
like Datalog programs. 
The fact \texttt{(edge 'a 'b)} indicates that the \texttt{edge} predicate
holds of nodes \texttt{'a} and \texttt{'b}.
The premise of the rule \texttt{((edge X Y) :- (edge Y X))} will be
instantiated with this fact, concluding \texttt{(edge 'b 'a)}.
These facts and rules thus encode an undirected graph.

\begin{verbatim}
  (((color X) is {'r 'g 'b}) :- (node X))
\end{verbatim}
The conclusion of this rule is a \emph{functional proposition}
(indicated with \texttt{is}), as opposed to the \emph{relational} propositions above.
A functional proposition must have exactly one associated value;
here, the associated value for each \texttt{color X} will
be a \emph{choice} among \texttt{'r}, \texttt{'g}, and \texttt{'b}.

Without any added constraints, the solutions will simply enumerate all
possible assignments of colors to nodes. We encode the additional constraint
that adjacent nodes have different color as follows to complete the program:

\begin{verbatim}
  ((ok) is {#t})
  (((ok) is {#f}) :- (edge X Y)
                     ((color X) is C)
                     ((color Y) is C)))
\end{verbatim}
The (functional) fact \texttt{((ok) is {\#t})} will always hold.
If adjacent nodes have the same color, then \texttt{((ok) is {\#f})}
will be concluded; this would violate the uniqueness requirement noted
above, causing any such solutions to be rejected.

We implement a relatively na√Øve solver based on the ``fact-set semantics''
described in~\cite{martens2025dusa}. Solving produces a stream of solutions,
each of which may be queried by users.


% say some stuff about our solver after describing the program
% the program describes solutions and we solve to find those solutions
